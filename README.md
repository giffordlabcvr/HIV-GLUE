# HIV-GLUE: A Sequence Data Resource for human immunodeficiency viruses.

Human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 cause
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

HIV-GLUE is a bioinformatics resource for HIV-1 sequence data.

This GLUE project contains


1.	A set of HIV-1 reference sequences (i.e. existing HIV-1 sequences that are well-annotated) with associated metadata
2.	Annotation of genome features and their specific location on at least one full genome reference sequence 
3.	An alignment of full genome reference sequences
4.	An alignment tree generated from (3) that defines the evolutionary relationships between sequences
5.	Import metadata for reference sequences 
6.	Create alignment tree
7.	Import data on amino acid variations

a.	e.g. drug resistant mutations
b.	Performed by the GenBank file populator
