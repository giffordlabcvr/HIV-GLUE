# HIV-GLUE: A Sequence Data Resource for human immunodeficiency viruses.

Human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 cause
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

HIV-GLUE is a bioinformatics resource for HIV-1 sequence data.

This GLUE project contains


1.	A set of HIV-1 reference sequences (i.e. existing HIV-1 sequences that are well-annotated) with associated metadata
2.	A list of genome features and their specific locations on full genome reference sequences
